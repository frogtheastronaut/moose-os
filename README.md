## Welcome

Hi, welcome to the MOOSE OS project!
MOOSE stands for 'Making Our Operating System Exist'.
This project has a few features, and I am adding more.

This is a hobby project of mine. Hopefully it can be of use to you.

Enjoy! - Ethan Z

## Changes since last release

- Shift key support
- Mouse Cursor
- Removed Pong
- Text Editor improved\
Oh yeah, and I turned it into an ISO.

## Current issues

(I am trying my best to fix these issues)

- Laggy
  - Lag is sometimes known to crash.

## Current Features

- *(Retro-themed) GUI*\
VGA Graphics!
- *Keyboard support*
- *File Explorer*\
Press 'D' in the file explorer to make a folder, and press 'F' to make a file.
Press 'Enter' to open a file/folder, and use arrow keys to change selection. Press Esc to exit.
- *Text Editor*\
The Text Editor auto saves your work, so just enter the file name in the dialog, and press
Esc when you want to exit.
- *Terminal*\
Terminal commands are: \
`ls` (list directory),\
`cd` (change directory),\
`mkdir` (make directory),\
`touch` (make file), \
`cat` (read file),\
`clear` (clear terminal),\
`time` (get date and time) and\
`settimezone` (change the time zone, eg. `settimezone 10` to set timezone to UTC+10). Press Esc to exit.
- *Date and Time*\
UTC time is shown by default. Use the terminal `settimezone` command to set your timezone.
The time is always shown in the dock.

# How to run

I am on an Macbook M1. I do not know how to run this code on any other device, but the MAKEFILE is exclusively made so someo

To be quite honest, when I first ran this code, I did a LOT of things to make it work. I can't give you a full idea on how to run this code, but I did something like this:

`brew install i386-elf-binutils qemu nasm`
